# Food-ingrdient-classification-system-using-ML-Algorithms


This project aims to classify food ingredients based on their features using Machine Learning algorithms. The prime algorithm used for classification is the Decision Tree algorithm, which has achieved an impressive accuracy of 99%.
The Food Ingredient Classification System is designed to automatically classify food ingredients based on their attributes. It utilizes Machine Learning algorithms to learn patterns from a given dataset and predict the ingredient type of unseen data.

This project specifically employs the Decision Tree algorithm as the primary classification algorithm due to its effectiveness in handling multi-class classification problems. With a trained Decision Tree model, the system can predict the ingredient category with high accuracy.

Install the required dependencies:
Run the system:

The accuracy of the trained Decision Tree model can be evaluated using various metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, a confusion matrix can be generated to assess the model's performance on different ingredient categories.

The script will display the evaluation metrics and generate the confusion matrix.
